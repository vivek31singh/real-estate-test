# Project Brief: None

## Project Type
Web Application (Frontend-focused)

## Project Goals (Golden Context)
To develop a high-performance, responsive, and visually engaging real estate frontend using Next.js. The goal is to simulate a fully functional property browsing experience, including search, filtering, and detailed property views, using robust dummy data. The application should serve as a scalable foundation that demonstrates modern UI patterns and can be easily connected to a backend API in the future.

## Complexity
Moderate
- Justification: While no backend integration is required, the project involves complex UI state management (filtering, favorites), responsive grid layouts, dynamic routing for property details, and the creation of reusable components. It sits between a simple landing page and a full-stack application due to the interactive nature of real estate browsing.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- UI Components: Radix UI (Primitives) + Tailwind (or a library like Shadcn UI)
- Icons: Lucide React
- State Management: React Context API or Zustand
- Data Simulation: Local JSON files and internal data fetching utilities
- Code Quality: ESLint, Prettier
